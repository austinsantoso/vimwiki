# Python

## Virtual Environment
Make sure you have virtualenv installed
```
pip install virtualenv
python -m pip install --user virtualenv
```

Rather than storing all libaries in a global folder, we store them locally based on the project.

To create a virtualenv:
```
virtualenv venv
```
This is create a folder venv where the virtual environment will be.

To active:
```
cd venv
source bin/activate
```
