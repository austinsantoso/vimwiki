# Network Layers
There are 7 layers is OSI model:
1. Application
2. Presentation
	- Preperation of data for application layer: encoding / decoding
3. Session
	- Handles session between user and server
4. Transport
5. Network
6. Data Link
7. Physical

In the OSI model, we only have 5
1. Application
	- What the users see / interacts with
	- HTTP / FTP
2. Transport
	- Coordinates the data transfer between end system and hosts.
	- (Transmission Control Protocol) TCP / (User Datagram Protocol) UDP
3. Network
	- Network layer is responsible for delivering packets to receiving hosts.
	- Routers will examine header fields of IP
4. Data Link
	- Sending of datagrams between adjacent nodes over a single link .
	- Receives data from Physical layer, can do error detetion / corretion
5. Physical
	- The electric signals in the transmission medium.
